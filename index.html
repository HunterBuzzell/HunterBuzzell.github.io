  <h3>About us:</h3>

  <strong>It is a <em>school</em> that <em>I'm</em> in</strong>
  <p>I like that in Oxford the food is <em>REALLY</em> good</p>
  <br>And at the time of making this website i am super hungry but i have it next hour so that makes me feel better
  <br> the bad side about that is that I  have to wait an <em>hour</em> before i can eat.
